Greetings! Currently, I am a Principal Biostatistician at [Tempus Labs](https://www.tempus.com/). Prior to joining the industry, I was an Assistant Professor of Biostatistics in the [School of Public Health](https://www.unr.edu/public-health) at the [University of Nevada-Reno](https://www.unr.edu/) from 2017 to 2022. I completed my PhD in the [School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences](https://www.clemson.edu/science/academics/departments/mathstat/index.html) at [Clemson University](https://www.clemson.edu/). Broadly, my research interests encompass the following domains:
- Longitudinal/survival analysis
- Biomarker/Biomonitoring analysis and evaluation
- Spatial/Spatio-temporal analysis
- Observational study design and analysis
- Causal inference 
- Statistical computing: Penalization, Gaussian Markov Random Fields, Machine learning algorithms, Bayesian hierarchical modeling
- Epidemiological/environmental health applications
