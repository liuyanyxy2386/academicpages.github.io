# Biomarker analysis and evaluation

A major part of my research is proposing novel statistical methodologies for biomarker measurements with complex structures, linked to EHR data. These measurements could arise from combined specimens (such as blood serum or urine) obtained by physically merging multiple individual samples, or through multi-stage probability sampling designs.

# Survival analysis

Another part of my research focuses on the development of precise and computationally efficient methods for prevalent survival models, such as proportional hazards (PH), proportional odds (PO), and accelerated failure time models. These techniques are tailored to handle a wide range of scenarios, including left-censored, right-censored, and interval-censored time-to-event observations. Dealing with interval-censored data presents a unique challenge, as conventional methods designed for right-censored data are not applicable. The main complexity arises from the lack of knowledge about the baseline hazard function inherent in the survival model.

To address this issue, we have introduced novel approaches that involve the application of penalized spline basis functions. Our methodologies have been detailed in various published manuscripts, outlining the significant strides we have made in this field.

# Spatial and Spatio-temporal modeling

I have also contributed to the field of spatial and spatio-temporal modeling within the realm of science. Specifically, in collaboration with our partners, we have gathered extensive testing data at the county level from clinics across the contiguous United States over a continuous period of six years. This data encompasses four prevalent canine infectious diseases: erlichiosis, anaplasmosis, lyme disease, and heartworm. Our objective in this endeavor was to pinpoint significant risk factors associated with the occurrence of these diseases. Our aim was also to construct models capable of reliably predicting future disease patterns on a national scale. To achieve this, we devised and put into practice a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal regression model. This model enabled us to evaluate the importance of the considered factors and to make highly accurate forecasts regarding future trends.

# Collaborative research

I have gained a significant amount of experience collaborating with researchers from various areas (e.g., epidemiology, environmental health, healthcare and behavioral health). I have been involved in projects such as developing Bayesian hierarchical models to calibrate and predict the concentration of wildfire smokes, assessing environmental injustice among the U.S. population, estimating soil and dust ingestion among U.S. children under age 6, and studying the pattern of urine drug testing among long term opioid users. My role in these studies involved ***examine potential selection bias***, ***design the study***, ***propose suitable statistical modeling (e.g., inverse probability weighting, longitudinal/survival model, generalized linear mixed model)***.
